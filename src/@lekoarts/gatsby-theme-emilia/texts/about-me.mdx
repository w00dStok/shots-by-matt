## About Me

Photography started as a creative outlet for me and quickly grew into something much deeper. It morphed into a way of noticing and honoring the beauty that surrounds us. From local landmarks and hidden corners of Michigan to travels abroad, I’m always chasing light, atmosphere, and those fleeting details that make a moment unforgettable. My hope is that my work doesn’t just show you what I saw, but also how it felt to stand there.
