Grand Haven at sunset feels like a song you don’t want to end. The pier stretches into the horizon, the lighthouse painted in gold and rose as the day leans into night. Waves catch the light and scatter it in every direction, while beachgoers linger with sand still clinging to their feet, unwilling to leave just yet. The air hums with the last notes of laughter, the scent of boardwalk fries, and the hush of Lake Michigan settling in. It’s a moment where time seems generous, letting you believe that summer could last forever.
