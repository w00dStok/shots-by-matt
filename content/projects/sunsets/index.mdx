A sunset is the sky’s way of exhaling. Colors spill across the horizon, careless yet deliberate, as if the day decided to sign its name in light. For a few minutes the ordinary becomes extraordinary. Rooftops glow, rivers catch fire, and silhouettes sharpen into quiet poetry. It’s never the same twice, always slipping away just as you lean in, which might be the secret of their charm. Sunsets don’t stay, they remind. They remind us to pause, to notice, to let the day end beautifully.
