Macro is where the small reveals its grandeur. A bee dusted in gold, bent over its work like a tiny priest of pollen. The veins of a leaf, drawn fine as stained glass. A flower’s heart, radiant and strange, waiting to be discovered. In these close-up worlds, the ordinary turns cosmic. Petals become landscapes, stamens rise like spires, and a single droplet holds an entire sky. To linger here with the lens is to be let in on nature’s whispered secrets, fleeting yet eternal, hidden in plain sight.
