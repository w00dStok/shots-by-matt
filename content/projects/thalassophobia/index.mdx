Thalassophobia is the feeling of the sea reminding you how small you are. A lone boat drifts, its outline swallowed by endless water, caught between horizon and depth. Buoys bob like quiet sentinels, their colors fading against the vast expanse. The surface sparkles with sunlight, but below waits a darkness that never fully reveals itself. There is beauty in the unease, a strange poetry in the way isolation and immensity meet. To look at these moments is to feel both awe and vertigo, wonder and hesitation, as if the water is asking whether you dare to look longer.
