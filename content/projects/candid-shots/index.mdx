Candid moments are where life forgets to pose. A laugh caught mid-flight, a glance that lingers a second too long, the way someone tucks hair behind their ear without thinking. These are the sparks that slip between the staged and the scripted. To capture people in these unguarded instants is to borrow a piece of their truth, not polished, not rehearsed, but beautifully human. Itâ€™s less about perfection and more about the rhythm of being, a dance of light, expression, and timing that says more than any portrait ever could.
